## Use Medisana BS444 scale with ESPHome on ESP32 in Home Assistant

BS430 users have a look at https://github.com/bwynants/weegschaal/tree/ESP32-BLE-Arduino

### how to setup

Add a reference to the code on github

    external_components:
      - source:
          type: git
          url: https://github.com/bwynants/weegschaal
          ref: main
        components: [ medisana_bs444 ]

or local on your esphome directory

    external_components:
      - source: 
          type: local
          path: components

add esphome ble tracker component

    esp32_ble_tracker:
      scan_parameters:
        interval: 1100ms
        window: 1100ms
        active: false

add esphome ble client component and set the correct MAC address

    ble_client:
      - mac_address: "00:00:00:00:00:00"
        id: medisanabs44_ble_id

    sensor:
      - platform: medisana_bs444
        ble_client_id: medisanabs44_ble_id
        timeoffset: true # BS410 and BS444 needs timeoffset, set to false for other scales
        weight_1:
          name: "Weight User 1"
        kcal_1:
          name: "kcal User 1"
        fat_1:
          name: "Fat User 1"
        tbw_1:
          name: "Water User 1"
        muscle_1:
          name: "Muscle User 1"
        bone_1:
          name: "Bone User 1"
        bmi_1:
          name: "BMI User 1"

        weight_2:
          name: "Weight User 2"
        kcal_2:
          name: "kcal User 2"
        fat_2:
          name: "Fat User 2"
        tbw_2:
          name: "Water User 2"
        muscle_2:
          name: "Muscle User 2"
        bone_2:
          name: "Bone User 2"
        bmi_2:
          name: "BMI User 2"

## add homeassistant time

    time:
      - platform: homeassistant
        id: homeassistant_time

## support

propably more medisana scales work BS410/BS430/BS440, but i only have the BS444 to test
